LibDS2A: Data Structures And Algorithms
---------------------------------------
ds2a is a utility library providing various data structures
and algorithms.

The lack of any real documentation is on purpose, I don't expect any to actually
need nor want to use this library. I just want the current version on github

Supported data structures:
	+ Generic linked lists (+ Double linked lists)

Supported algorithms:
	+ Merge Sort (Generic, double linked lists)
	+ Siphash-2-4

### Generic Linked Lists
Generic linked lists are implemented as a header and user-defined data:

	+-------------------------+-------------------------+
	| 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 | 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 |
	+-------------------------+-------------------------+
	|     Forward Pointer     |     User Data Length    | <--- Node Header
	+-------------------------+-------------------------+
	|             Variable Length User Data             |
	|                       ....                        |
	+---------------------------------------------------+

The forward pointer is always the first 8 bytes of a node header, regardless of whether
the list is a double linked list or not. if so, the backward pointer follows it, then the
user data length.

The merge function operates on a callback function supplied as an argument. This function
is user defined and must return either -1 or 1 and expects two nodes to be compared:

If the callback(left, right) function returns:

	 1: the right node is inserted before the left node (left->bk = right)
	-1: the right node is inserted after the left node (left->fw = right)

any other value returned is ignored for now (although this may change).
